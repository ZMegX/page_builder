2. Click "Save"

### For Google Docs/Slides/Sheets
1. Open your Google Doc/Slides/Sheets
2. Click "Share" â†’ "Get link"

## Viewing Documents

### Users can:
- Browse documents by category
- View embedded Google Docs directly on the page
- Download PDF files
- Open Google Docs in a new tab
- See view counts for each document

## Tips for Best Results

### Google Docs Sharing
- Always set to "Anyone with the link can view"
- Use the full sharing URL (not shortened links)
- Wait a moment after sharing before adding to the system

### File Uploads
- PDFs work best for formal documents
- Images are great for screenshots and diagrams
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 10MB recommended)

### Organization
- Use the "Order" field to control display sequence
- Group related documents in the same category
- Use clear, descriptive titles

## URL Format Examples

**Google Docs:**
```
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABC123XYZ/edit
```

**Google Slides:**
```
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ABC123XYZ/edit
```

**Google Sheets:**
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123XYZ/edit
```

## Troubleshooting

### Google Doc not displaying?
1. Check that the document is set to "Anyone with the link can view"
2. Verify the URL is correct
3. Try regenerating the embed URL by editing and saving the document

### File not uploading?
1. Check file size (Cloudinary free tier has limits)
2. Verify file type is supported
3. Check internet connection

## View Tracking
- Each document tracks how many times it's been viewed
- Useful for understanding which documents are most accessed
- View count increments when someone clicks "View Document"
